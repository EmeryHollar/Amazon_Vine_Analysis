# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Using AWS/SQL/PySpark 
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to use PySpark and perform the ETL process to extract a dataset from an Amazon reviews program. Then we were supposed to use PySpark and Pandas to determine bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members. I had difficultly with this assignment because I recently lost my hard drive and all computer programs. I am using a family member's laptop, so it was difficult for me to download some of the programs neccessary to complete this challenge. I was successful in completing the first deliverable and successfully loaded in an Amazon Vine dataset into Google Collab and filtered the dataframe. I could not however connect to an AWS RDS instance and complete the pgAdmin section of this challenge.
